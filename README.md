## iframe-from-attachment ##

This simple [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin converts a code block of type `iframe-from-attachment` containing the (relative) path to an HTML file (usually an attachment) within your vault into an iFrame.

The main benefit of using this plugin instead of an `<iframe>` HTML element is the possibility to refer to a local attachment rather than an external URL - independent of the absolute location of your Obsidian vault (and independent of your platform)
